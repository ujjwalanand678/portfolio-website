      Hi! I’m Ujjwal Anand , a passionate Full-Stack Developer specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). I love building clean, responsive web applications that solve real-world problems.

I enjoy turning complex ideas into intuitive, scalable solutions — whether that’s a dynamic eCommerce store, a secure authentication system, or an interactive dashboard.

I’m always learning new technologies and best practices. Lately, I’ve been exploring Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Socket.io to build modern, real-time web experiences.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring open-source projects, reading tech blogs, or experimenting with new side projects. I’m always excited to collaborate and bring ideas to life.

Let’s connect and create something amazing together!
